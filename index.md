## Projects

### Finance
- [Exploring Equity Returns](https://github.com/beaukramer/financial_analysis/blob/master/equity_returns.ipynb)
- [Eigen Portfolios]
- [CPI Visualization]

### Machine Learning

- [Automated Essay Grading and Inference Using Linear and Deep Learning Models](https://github.com/pkurapati/W266-NLP-Project/blob/master/W266_Automated_Essay_Grading.pdf) 
> NLP | Deep Learning | Machine Learning | Feature Engineering | Data Visualization
For this NLP project, my team selected an automated essay grading challenge. We were interested in automatically generating feedback for students and for contrasting linear models with deep learning ones. We performed extensive feature engineering and trained deep learning models on an essay and sentence level. 


- [News Article Topic Classification](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/ML/TopicClassification/topic_classification.ipynb): I trained classifiers using a bag-of-words model to identify the topic of a news article. After some intial attempts at the problem, I applied some preprocessing to the texts which improved the ability of the model to generalize.
> NLP | Machine Learning | Data Processing

- [Poisnous Mushroom Clustering](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/ML/Mushroom%20Clustering/mushroom_clustering.ipynb) Using PCA to reduce dimensionality, I clustered data about mushrooms to try to classify poisonous ones. I used KMeans and Gaussian Mixture Models.

- [Forest Cover Prediction](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/ML/ForestCoverPrediction/Forest_Cover_Master_v4.ipynb) For this group project, my team selected the forest cover prediction challenge. We had to predict the species of tree that lived in a 30x30m cell in several Colorado forests. We summarized our lessons learned in this [presentation](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/ML/ForestCoverPrediction/Forest_Cover_Prediction_Type.pdf).


- [Digit Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/ML/MNIST/MNIST_knn_nb.ipynb): The Hello World! of data science projects. After covering the basics of a classification tasks, I moved on to some preprocessing techniques like blurring and used Naive Bayes to generate digits.



### Statistics
- [Forest Fire EDA](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/Stats/ForestFire/liu_warther_kramer_hegde_fires.pdf) The focus of this project was on the importance of exploratory data analysis in any project. We explored a dataset about a portuguese national park that experienced severe wild fires to see if we could begin predicting conditions that make an area vulnerable to extreme fires.
- [Crime Policy North Carolina](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/Stats/Crime/Kramer_Liu_crime.pdf) Classic linear regression was the focus of this project. We were given a dataset about crime in North Carolina in the 1980s with the goal of providing policy recommendations to politicians.
- [Challenger Explosion](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/Stats/Challenger/Kramer_Papandrew_Challenger.pdf) This discrete response modeling project addressed whether temperature and/or pressure have a relationship with the failure of the primary o-rings in the space shuttle.
- [Cereal](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/Stats/Cereal/Kramer_Papandrew_Cereal.pdf)
- [Time Series Forecasting with SARIMA Model](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/Stats/TimeSeries/Kramer_Papandrew_TS.pdf)
- [Drunk Driving](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/Stats/DrunkDriving/Kramer_Papandrew_DrunkDriving.pdf)
