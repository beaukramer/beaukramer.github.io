## Projects

### Finance
- [Exploring Equity Returns](https://github.com/beaukramer/financial_analysis/blob/master/equity_returns.ipynb)
- [Eigen Portfolios]

### Machine Learning
- [Digit Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/ML/MNIST/MNIST_knn_nb.ipynb): The Hello World! of data science projects. After covering the basics of a classification tasks, I moved on to some preprocessing techniques like blurring and used Naive Bayes to generate digits.
- [News Article Topic Classification](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/ML/TopicClassification/topic_classification.ipynb): I trained classifiers using a bag-of-words model to identify the topic of a news article. After some intial attempts at the problem, I applied some preprocessing to the texts which improved the ability of the model to generalize.
- [Poisnous Mushroom Clustering](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/ML/Mushroom%20Clustering/mushroom_clustering.ipynb) Using PCA to reduce dimensionality, I clustered data about mushrooms to try to classify poisonous ones. I used KMeans and Gaussian Mixture Models.
- [Forest Cover Prediction](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/ML/ForestCoverPrediction/Forest_Cover_Master_v4.ipynb) For this group project, my team selected the forest cover prediction challenge. We had to predict the species of tree that lived in a 30x30m cell in several Colorado forests. We summarized our lessons learned in this [presentation] (https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/ML/ForestCoverPrediction/Forest_Cover_Prediction_Type.pdf).
- [Automated Essay Grading] (https://github.com/pkurapati/W266-NLP-Project/blob/master/W266_Automated_Essay_Grading.pdf)

### Statistics
- [Forest Fire EDA](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/Stats/ForestFire/liu_warther_kramer_hegde_fires.pdf)
- [Crime Policy North Carolina](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/Stats/Crime/Kramer_Liu_crime.pdf)
- [Challenger Explosion](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/Stats/Challenger/Kramer_Papandrew_Challenger.pdf)
- [Cereal](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/Stats/Cereal/Kramer_Papandrew_Cereal.pdf)
- [Time Series Forecasting with SARIMA Model](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/Stats/TimeSeries/Kramer_Papandrew_TS.pdf)
- [Drunk Driving](https://github.com/beaukramer/mids/blob/master/Stats/DrunkDriving/Kramer_Papandrew_DrunkDriving.pdf)
